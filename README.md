* Advanced_ML_Project_Poster.pdf: Poster for presentation.

* bert_full_data.ipynb: BERT model code that is performed on full dataset.

* bert_sample.ipynb: Running of BERT model on a smaller sample of 100,000 observations (1/3 of the full data). Our BERT results we report in the final paper reflect the results in this code.

* BoW.ipynb: Jupyter notebook that first bag-of-words model on data, plots accuracy metrics.

* CNN.ipynb: Jupyter notebook that fits CNN model, produces plots of accuracy metrics.

* data_loader.ipynb:

* survey_analysis.ipynb: Jupyter notebook that computes survey accuracy metrics reported in final paper.
