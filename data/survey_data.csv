Timestamp,Score,"The Icebergs is an 1861 oil painting by the American landscape artist Frederic Edwin Church. It was inspired by his 1859 voyage to the North Atlantic around Newfoundland and Labrador. Considered one of Church's ""Great Pictures""—measuring —the painting depicts one or more icebergs in the afternoon light of the Arctic. It was first displayed in New York City in 1861, where visitors paid 25 cents' admittance to the one-painting show. Similar exhibitions in Boston and London followed. The unconventional landscape of ice, water, and sky generally drew praise, but the American Civil War, which began the same year, lessened critical and popular interest in New York City's cultural events. The painting became popular within Church's oeuvre and inspired other landscape artists' interest in the Arctic, but its apparent lack of narrative or allegory perplexed some viewers. Between exhibitions in the US and England, Church added the ship mast to the painting, and retitled the work from its original The North. He eventually sold the painting in England, where it disappeared from the art-world's awareness after the buyer's death in 1901. 
In 1979, the painting, which a number of New York City galleries were now hunting, was rediscovered in a home in Manchester, England, where it had remained for most of the intervening 78 years. It was soon put to auction in New York City, drawing significant interest as its sale coincided with renewed critical interest in Church, who had been largely forgotten in the 20th century. The Icebergs was auctioned for US$2.5 million, the most of any American painting to that point. The buyers, later identified as businessman Lamar Hunt and his wife Norma, donated the canvas to the Dallas Museum of Art, where it remains today.","In photography and graphic arts a flopped image is a technical term for a static or moving image that is generated by a mirror-reversal of an original image across a vertical axis.  This is opposed to a flipped image, which means an image reversed across a horizontal axis.  Flopping can be used to improve the subjective aesthetic appeal of the image in question. Use in advertising 
There are two main uses in advertising, one practical, and one subjective.  On a practical level, images of cars are often flopped to ensure cars look appropriate for left-hand-drive or right-hand-drive markets. This allows the results of a single production shoot to be used across markets, allowing a cost saving. On a subjective level, the direction in which a person is looking or a car appears to be travelling may be regarded as important. When placing a picture on a page of text, it is usual for depictions of people to face into the text, rather than off the page; thus, when compositing a page, a picture may be flopped so it may be placed either side of a column of text.","Jeffrey Alan Dellenbach (born February 14, 1963 in Wausau, Wisconsin) is a former American football center in the National Football League for the Miami Dolphins, New England Patriots, Green Bay Packers, and the Philadelphia Eagles. He was a member of the Green Bay Packers when they won Super Bowl XXXI. 
Dellenbach played college football at the University of Wisconsin–Madison and was drafted by the Dolphins in the fourth round of the 1985 NFL Draft. Dellenbach served as the head coach at Boca Raton (Fla.) High School, but resigned in May 2014 after just one season. “I’m pursuing other interests,” Dellenbach wrote in a text message. In Dellenbach’s only season as head coach, the Bobcats finished with a 4-6 record and missed the playoffs in 2013. 
Before arriving at Boca Raton, the 51-year-old spent two seasons at Plantation-American Heritage and won two district titles. In three seasons at Coconut Creek-North Broward Prep, Dellenbach posted a 22-11 record. He also served as an assistant offensive line coach for the Dolphins from 2003-2005.","Bridgestone motorcycles were a division of the Bridgestone Corporation which produced motorcycles from 1946 to 1966. 
During the postwar years, motorcycles were becoming popular as a form of transportation. There were many different brands of motorcycles available, and consumers had a lot of choice. Bridgestone wanted to enter the motorcycle market, but they didn’t have the resources to do so on their own. They turned to their partner, Yamaha, who had a more established motorcycle business.
Bridgestone and Yamaha worked together to create a new brand of motorcycle – the Bridgestone Motorcycle Company. The first motorcycles produced by the Bridgestone Motorcycle Company were named the B-Model. These motorcycles had a lot of features that were new at the time, including a cast-steel frame and twin-cylinder engines.
The B-Model was a success, and the company continued to produce motorcycles for several years. In 1966, Bridgestone decided to stop producing motorcycles and focus on other products. However, the brand still exists today and is owned by the Japanese company Sumitomo Rubber Industries","Anne Ector Pleasant (April 16, 1878 – September 13, 1934) was an American school teacher and founder of the private school Pleasant Hall in Shreveport which operated for more than fifty years. Between 1916 and 1920, she was the First Lady of Louisiana and though she supported women's suffrage, she was not in favor of passage of the Nineteenth Amendment, believing voting rights were a state rather than a federal issue. Early life
Anne Ector was born on April 16, 1878, in Marshall, Texas to Sarah Parish ""Sally"" (née Chew) and General Matthew D. Ector. Her father was a brigadier general in the Confederate States Army, who was wounded during the Atlanta Campaign in 1864 and then returned to Texas where he served as a judge. At the time of his death in 1879, he was the presiding judge of the Court of Appeals. Her mother was originally from Kentucky and after her husband's death raised Anne and her siblings, Helen, Walker and William. Ector attended Belwood Seminary in Anchorage, Kentucky and went on to further her schooling at the Sam Houston Normal Institute in Huntsville, Texas, graduating in 1899.","Merlin German (November 15, 1985 – April 11, 2008) was a United States Marine sergeant stationed in Iraq who survived a roadside bomb blast in 2005. He became a symbol of recovery throughout the United States, soon known as the ""Miracle Marine,"" during the 17 months he spent hospitalized following the blast. German eventually regained the ability to walk, and set up a charity for child burn victims.  Just over three years after the blast, he died following a minor skin graft surgery. Early life and education
German was born in New York City's Manhattan, on November 15, 1985, to Hemery and Lourdes German, immigrants from the Dominican Republic. He grew up in Washington Heights with seven siblings: sisters Marcia and Lawren, and brothers Ariel, Freddie, Johnny, Alejandro and Julio. By the age of 11, he told one of his brothers, Ariel, that he wanted to be a Marine when he grew up. In 2001, he moved to Greenburgh, New York, to avoid moving to the Dominican Republic with his parents, and attended Woodlands High School for his junior and senior years. He moved in with one of his sisters, Lawren German, and her husband, his brother-in-law, Rafael Diaz, along with their three sons, his nephews, Ralph Junior, Matt, and Isaiah. In high school, he spent most days working out in the gym and joined a program where he'd run with Marines on weekends, trying to get in shape for boot camp.","The Central Midland Railway , a division of the Great Central Railway, was opened in 1894. It served the counties of Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire, Leicestershire and Rutland. It was absorbed by the London and North Eastern Railway in 1923.","Post-Apocalypto is the fourth studio album by American rock band Tenacious D. Produced by bassist John Spiker, it was released in North America on November 2, 2018, by Columbia Records. In addition to core members Jack Black and Kyle Gass, the album also marks the return of John Konesky (electric guitar), Spiker (bass) and Dave Grohl (drums), who have all performed on previous Tenacious D albums. The album features songs and audio snippets from Tenacious D in Post-Apocalypto, the band's animatic YouTube series to support the album. Background
In June 2012, when asked about a sequel to Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny, Black stated that the band had ""found a loophole with the internet and animated shorts. That’s the world we’re looking to dive into, and not just for money, mainly for art."" The band would mention later on in that year that they may make an Internet series ""exclusive to YouTube"" The project was a fantasy for Black and Gass for a few years, until the Donald Trump Presidential Campaign inspired them to write a post-apocalyptic pilot episode in 2016. The remaining episodes would be completed between 2017 and 2018.","Uncovered/Covered is a collaborative studio album by American rock band The Black Keys. It was released on September 16, 2016, through Fat Possum Records.
The Black Keys began work on the album in early 2016, shortly after the release of their seventh album ""El Camino"". The band enlisted producer Danger Mouse to help with production and recorded at his studio in Brooklyn.
""Uncovered/Covered"" is a concept album which tells the story of two lovers who are forced to keep their relationship a secret. The songs explore themes of love, loss, and secrecy.
The album received generally positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 73, which indicates ""generally favorable reviews"".","The Battle of Sörenberg was fought in 1634 between the Protestant Union of Germany and the Catholic League. The Union was led by Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden, while the League was led by the Duke of Bavaria. The battle ended in a Protestant victory, which helped to secure Sweden's position as a leading power in Northern Europe.","Art and Aesthetics: a Promenade ab Homine
    In the broadest sense, aesthetics is the study of beauty, which is defined as the power of art to influence the emotions and provide pleasure. It encompasses both the objective and subjective aspects of art, and examines the principles which govern its production, appreciation, and interpretation.
For centuries, art has been used to communicate messages and evoke feelings in those who view it. Whether it is a painting, sculpture, or piece of music, art can evoke a range of powerful emotions in its viewers. While there is no one right way to experience art, most aestheticians believe that it is important to explore different perspectives and look for beauty in all forms.
Aesthetics has been a central concern of artists and philosophers for centuries, and there is still much to be learned about how art affects our emotions and how we experience beauty. While many debates remain unresolved, aesthetic theory has provided us with valuable insights into how we perceive the world around us.","Night Ripper is the third studio album by American metalcore band Killswitch Engage. It was released on October 20, 2002, through Roadrunner Records.
After achieving commercial success with their self-titled debut album and its follow-up, ""Alive or Just Breathing"", Killswitch Engage experienced lineup changes and a change in musical direction with their fourth album, ""The End of the Line"". ""Night Ripper"" is a return to their metalcore roots, featuring faster tempos and heavier riffs. 
The album received mixed reviews from music critics. Some praised Killswitch Engage's return to their metalcore roots, while others found the album too derivative of their previous work. However, the album reached number 25 on the ""Billboard"" 200 chart and spawned two singles, ""Insurrection"" and ""Voices in the Dark"".
Killswitch Engage was founded in Worcester, Massachusetts in 1994 by vocalist Jesse Leach and guitarist Adam Dutkiewicz. The band released its self-titled debut album in 1998 and it achieved commercial success. Following the release of their second album, ""Alive or Just Breathing"", Dutkiewicz left the band and was replaced by Mike D'Antonio. After recording their fourth album, ""The End of the Line"", Leach left the band to join As I Lay Dying. 
With Leach gone, Killswitch Engage began working on their fifth album, ""Night Ripper"".","Monte Bank, Mountebank, Spanish Monte and Mexican Monte are all names for a mountain in northwestern Mexico. The peak is located in the states of Sonora and Baja California, approximately midway between the cities of Hermosillo and Tijuana. 
The mountain is part of the Sierra Madre Occidental mountain range and is located in the municipalities of San Pedro Garza García and San Rafael, about north-northwest of the city of Hermosillo. The summit is above sea level.
The banks of the Colorado River on either side of the mountain are popular with tourists for hiking, sightseeing, camping, and fishing. The mountain has four peaks: Cerro Prieto, Cerro de la Balsa, Cerro del Condor, and Cerro de los Remedios. 
The name Monte Bank comes from Spanish monte (mountain), bank (a steep slope or cliff), and presumably refers to the steep cliffs on either side of the mountain. The name may also refer to a hermit who lived on the peak in the early days. The first mention of Monte Bank was in 1697.","Rugosodon is an extinct genus of multituberculate (rodent-like) mammals from eastern China that lived 160 million years ago during the Jurassic period. The discovery of its type species and currently only known species Rugosodon eurasiaticus was reported in the 16 August 2013 issue of Science. Description
Rugosodon is represented by a nearly complete fossilized skeleton, including a skull, that bears a strong resemblance to a small rat or a chipmunk. The mammal is estimated to have weighed between 65 and 80 g, about that of an average chipmunk. The generic name Rugosodon (Latin for ""wrinkly tooth"") refers to the rugosity, or wrinkliness, of the distinctively shaped teeth. Its teeth indicate that the animal was an omnivore, well-adapted to gnawing both plants and animals, including fruits and seeds, worms, insects and small vertebrates. Its ankle joints were highly mobile at rotation. This means that the ankle is remarkably flexible, allowing the foot to hyper-extend downward — like a ballerina standing on pointed toes — and to rotate through a wide range of motion. This feature, along with highly mobile digits, defines the multituberculates and is not seen in other mammalian lineages of the era. Rugosodon also had a highly flexible spine, which would have allowed it to twist both left to right and front to back. Due to the proportions of its hand bones, it is thought to have been terrestrial rather than arboreal. Its diet was likely omnivorous.","Tabula rasa (; ""blank slate"") is the philosophical concept that the mind is a tabula rasa or ""blank sheet of paper"" upon which experience writes.
The doctrine of tabula rasa was first proposed by the Greek philosopher Plato in his dialogue The Republic. It has been suggested that the doctrine reflects an ancient belief in the power of the divine to create beings without preconception. In its most extreme form, tabula rasa may be interpreted to imply that humans are born without any innate ideas or morals.","A carpet bag is a top-opening travelling bag, usually made of cotton canvas or leather, used by men and women in the 19th century. The bag was originally a piece of luggage that could be carried on the back, but it later evolved into a small bag that a person could carry on their shoulder.","Presenilins are a family of related multi-pass transmembrane proteins which constitute the catalytic subunits of the gamma-secretase intramembrane protease protein complex. They were first identified in screens for mutations causing early onset forms of familial Alzheimer's disease by Peter St George-Hyslop. Vertebrates have two presenilin genes, called PSEN1 (located on chromosome 14 in humans) that codes for presenilin 1 (PS-1) and PSEN2 (on chromosome 1 in humans) that codes for  presenilin 2 (PS-2). 
Both genes show conservation between species, with little difference between rat and human presenilins. The nematode worm C. elegans has two genes that resemble the presenilins and appear to be functionally similar, sel-12 and hop-1. Presenilins undergo cleavage in an alpha helical region of one of the cytoplasmic loops to produce a large N-terminal and a smaller C-terminal fragment that together form part of the functional protein. Cleavage of presenilin 1 can be prevented by a mutation that causes the loss of exon 9, and results in loss of function. Presenilins play a key role in the modulation of intracellular Ca2+ involved in presynaptic neurotransmitter release and long-term potentiation induction.","Michael (""Mike"") Schmid (born 18 March 1984) is a Swiss professional ski mountaineer, mountain guide and Search and Rescue specialist. He is the first Swiss skier to summit both Mount Everest and K2.
Schmid was born in 1984 in Davos, Switzerland, and started skiing at the age of six. In 2002, he became the Swiss Junior Champion in ski mountaineering, and two years later he won the Junior World Cup title. In 2006, Schmid made his first ascent of Mount Everest as part of the Swiss team, becoming the first Swiss skier to reach the summit. Two years later, he became the first Swiss skier to summit K2. 
Since then Schmid has continued to make major ascents, including Mount Aconcagua (twice), Mount Kilimanjaro (twice), and Mount Blanc du Tacul in France. In 2018 he became the first person to ski solo from sea level to the summit of Mount Everest. 
Schmid also works as a mountain guide and Search and Rescue specialist. In 2010 he founded Mountain Rescue Davos, a non-profit organisation that provides training and support for mountain rescue teams in the canton of Davos. He has also served as President of the Swiss Ski Mountaineering Federation (SSMF) since 2016.","The United States version of  Tiger Lily Records''' was a record label that was run by Roulette Records founder Morris Levy.  Purportedly it was a tax scam created by Levy and was never intended to make a profit.  Tiger Lily's primary modus operandi was to acquire demo tapes from artists or studios and then release them without the artists consent and sometimes without even the artist's knowledge. 
Other albums released by Tiger Lily have been identified as bootlegs of albums released in the early 1970s by Artie Ripp's Family Productions and two cases of performers who were actually signed to Tiger Lily Records have been identified.  The most prominent artists known to have a record released by Tiger Lily were Richard Pryor, whose album L.A. Jail was released by Tiger Lily, and Rod Stewart, who had a live recording of him in performance at the 1973 Reading and Leeds Festivals released by Tiger Lily in 1976 under the title Reading Festival Featuring Rod Stewart''.  The album credited to Stewart was really a collection of various artists from the Reading Festival, with Rod Stewart and the Faces only appearing on one track. 
The most expensive and best known Tiger Lily Records release is the album  ""Stonewall"" credited to a band of the same name. It has sold for as much as $14,100.","Il pesceballo (The Fish-Ball) is a 19th-century American pasticcio opera in one act featuring the music of Bellini, Donizetti, Mozart, and Rossini, with a spoof Italian libretto by Francis James Child which makes use of some of grand opera's most popular melodies. The recitatives and chorus parts were written by John Knowles Paine, and James Russell Lowell translated the libretto into English. 
Child was a Harvard English professor and opera lover, and the text was originally inspired by an incident which occurred to a colleague of his. One evening George Martin Lane was trying to make his way to Cambridge, MA, from Boston. He discovered that he had only 25 cents, which was not enough for both supper and the fare needed to get to Cambridge. As he was very tired and hungry, he stopped at a local diner and asked for half of a serving of macaroni. After he had recounted the story to his friends, he wrote a comic ballad, called the Lay of the One Fishball.  A fishball was a fried New England concoction made of potatoes and fish stock, and usually eaten for breakfast. 
The ballad became very popular with Harvard students, and inspired Child's opera; it also became the source for the popular Tin Pan Alley song, ""One Meat Ball""."
